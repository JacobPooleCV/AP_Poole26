Every lab folder should have 3 folders:

notes - These are the PDF notes of the current lesson, the lab instructions are at the end of the notes
base_code - This is a template folder for you to write your answer solution in!
labOutput - This is the IDEAL answer solution. When you make your lab, try your best to replicate it.
To run the labOutput of labs do the following:

Right click the "labOutput" folder
Select "Open Terminal Here"
Then in that terminal, type "java starter" - This will run the program
